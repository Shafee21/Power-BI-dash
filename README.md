# Data Jobs Dashboard w/ Power BI

![Dashboard Page 1](images/dashboard%20main.png)

## Introduction

This dashboard was built by following **Luke Barousse’s official guided Power BI project**, which walks through building a complete data visualization solution from start to finish. The goal of the project is to analyze the 2024 data job market using a real-world dataset of job postings.

Targeted at **Job Seekers**, **Career Transitioners**, and **Job Swappers**, the dashboard helps solve a common problem: data about the job market is scattered and hard to interpret. This report brings it all together into an interactive, easy-to-use format that highlights key trends in job titles, salaries, and geographic demand.
