# Power BI Dashboard Portfolio

This repository contains a series of **Power BI dashboards** created as part of my **learning process** in **data visualization**. The work is based on guided tutorials by **Luke Barousse**, with the aim of building competency in developing **interactive reports** and transforming data into **meaningful insights**.

## Featured Dashboards

The dashboards included here are **structured learning projects**. Each one focuses on specific **techniques** and **design approaches** in Power BI.
